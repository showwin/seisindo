        Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a series of symptoms prior to beginning of menstrual period. These symptoms include �gmentally depressed status�h, �geasy to get angry�h, �gtense breasts with pain�h, �gvomit�h, �gdiarrhea�h and so forth. Most starts from a week or two weeks prior to menstrual period and disappears upon beginning of menstrual period. Those who with light symptoms may be able to endure but those who with severe symptoms may have effects in business and/or daily life. And recurrence of labial and/or genital herpes is found in many cases.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="+2" color="#0000ff">In TCM it is roughly classified into three:<br>
        </font><font size="+1" color="#cc00cc"><br>
        Type A (Excess)   Liver Depression Qi Stagnation</font><font size="+1"><br>
        It is caused by stagnation of Qi due to mental stress. It is identified with symptoms such as mental depression, easy to get angry, abdominal swelling, tense breasts with pain, irregular menstrual period cycle and so forth before or after menstrual period.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="+1" color="#cc00cc">Type B (Deficiency)   Spleen and Stomach Weakness</font><font size="+1"><br>
        Water dampness (moisture unnecessary to the body) is caused due to either weak digestive system to begin with or poor eating habits and/or daily life style causing damage to the digestive system thus damaging the function of Spleen. Therefore symptoms mainly on digestive system appear. It is identified with symptoms such as feeling of fullness at stomach, soft stool, diarrhea, sense of fatigue, edema and so forth before or after menstrual period.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="+1" color="#cc00cc">Type C (Deficiency)   Kidney Yin Deficiency</font><font size="+1"><br>
        It is generated either by insufficient �gKidney Yin�h due to original physical constitution of �gKidney Qi Deficiency�h or damaged �gEssence Blood�h due to excess sexual intercourse. It is identified with symptoms such as being muddleheaded, sense of exhaustion, ear ringing, having trouble to getting sleep, many dreams, glow, hot flash, sluggishness in back and knees and so forth before or after menstrual period. <br>
        <br>
        Though it was roughly classified into three types, few people will fit just like these. In many cases different types are overlapped with these or new symptoms are found based on these.<br>
