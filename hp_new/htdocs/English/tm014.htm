        <td width="650" align="left"><b><font size="+1">In TCM allergen such as pollen and house dust are considered to be �gWind Evil�h. For healthy people incursion of evil from outside is prevented by   defense qi. For those who suffer from allergic rhinitis or hay fever has insufficient defense qi for some reasons. And even evil which would not have caused any harm upon incursion comes to cause running nose, stuffed nose and sneezing.<br>
</font><font size="+2" color="#0000ff">In TCM root cause is investigated</font><font size="+1"><br>Allergic rhinitis is classified into seasonal hay fever and perennial house dust. In former there is much cold fluid retention. Cold fluid is generated inside of the body due to excess intake of cold foods and drink during summer which will turn to �grunning nose�h in the spring by stimulation such as pollen. <br>
Running nose and sneezing are regarded as �gcold symptom�h in TCM caused by coldness. However, depending on yang qi of spring and/or physical constitution these will be �gheated up�h and in a lot of case it will be converted into �gheat symptom�h such as itchy eyes, bloodshot and stuffed nose. And even this type of person will resume to the symptom such as running nose and sneezing while sun is down and yang qi of external world is decreased. <br>
In TCM fluid metabolism is regarded to be established upon collaboration of �gSpleen�h, �gLung�h and �gKidney�h under control of �gLiver�h.<br>
Thus prescription differs depending on which parts of what has troubles.</font></b><br>

        <font color="#cc0000" size="+1"><b>1 Habit of intake of too much fluid</b></font><br>
        <b><font size="+1">This is a habit of taking much fluid even though one is not thirsty. Particularly found in many people is that taking cold fluid even during winter. It is very often questioned that it would be all right or not if it is hot fluid. But excess intake of fluid regardless cold or hot is not good.</font></b><br>
        <font size="+1"><b><font color="#cc0000" size="+1">2 Habit of light clothing</font></b></font><br>
        <b><font size="+1">This is the case wrong hygiene such as improving fragile constitution and/or
        allergic constitution by wearing light clothing is implemented. By doing
        this the body is always under coldness and drying and �gqi�h named �gdefense
        qi�h which protects body surface from change of external world is depleted.
        This depletion of �gdefense qi�h is also a cause of hay fever</font></b>.<br>
        <font color="#cc0000" size="+1"><b>3 Shortage of sleep</b></font><br>
        <b><font size="+1">By shortage of sleep depletion of �gyin�h which is fluid and nutritious substances to the body is increased. And it causes situations in which inner heat is likely to be generated by imbalance of �gyin�h and �gyang�h of the body. It causes symptoms such as dryness and itchiness of eyes and noses at the time of awakening. When shortage of sleep continues on regular basis, not only �gyin�h but also �gyang�h as �gqi�h will become insufficient. And it will affect �gdefense qi�h and �glung qi�h which worsen the symptom of hay fever.</font></b><br>
