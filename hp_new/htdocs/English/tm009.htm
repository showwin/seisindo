      which pathologically anxious state is the main feature. Suddenly symptoms
      like severe and unfounded anxiety accompanied by palpitation, difficulty
      in breathe, dizziness, shivering, and sweating. At the time of attack,
      its main symptom is repeated �gPanic Attack�h such as very strong fear that
      �gif this goes on I will die�h.<br>
        Upon experiencing panic attack for some times some people are obsessed with �gAnticipatory Anxiety�h that there will be attack again associated with change in behavior pattern to avoid place and status under which the attack took a place. This is called panic disorder.<br>
        �gAgoraphobia�h is identified by strong anxiety and fear when one is out in crowd or machines such as train or airplane. Though agoraphobia is not a mandatory symptom like panic attack and anticipatory anxiety in panic disorder, it is one of important symptom indeed. �gAgora�h, by the way, does not refer to large space here. It refers to �gAgora�h in Greek meaning an open space with many people and markets.<br>
