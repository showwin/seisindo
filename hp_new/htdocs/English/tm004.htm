      <B><FONT size="+2">�@</FONT><FONT size="4" color="#ff0000" face="MS UI Gothic">&quot;Damp Heat&quot; a concept particular to TCM.</FONT><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic"> Usually moisture taken in the body will be used effectively and unnecessary
portion will be discharged from the body. However, when the function of
&quot;Spleen(a digestive organ system at large)&quot; has weakened, or
when &quot;Lungs (HAI)&quot; and the &quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot; have weakened,
this moisture will not be discharged from the body. It stays inside of
the body and becomes &quot;unnecessary moisture&quot;. <BR>
      �@This &quot;moisture unnecessary for the body&quot; is called &quot;Damp.&quot; When there is this &quot;Damp&quot;, &quot;Damp heat&quot; will be generater by heat wihtin the body. Imagine boiling down &quot;sugared water&quot;. As far as origin of this &quot;heat&quot; is concerned, overheated stomach deu to disorder of eating habits and life style is likely to be the cause in most cases. This &quot;Heat&quot; is called &quot;Stomach heat&quot;. Moreover, &quot;Heat&quot; may be generated from functional rise of a &quot;Liver &quot; by psychological stress. This &quot;Heat&quot; is called &quot;Liver heat&quot;. </FONT><FONT size="+1"><BR>

      �@When there is bleb, Damp Heat is removed. Then in case there is still
pain after skin has recovered to normal condition, Qi and Blood shall be
replenished.�@Frequent break out of herpes is likely to be due to your
physical constitution. TCM�@considers that herpes doesn't develop if there
is enough Qi and Blood in the body. </FONT><FONT size="+1"><BR>

      <B><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic">�@The Qi and Blood is generated with the Spleen (the whole digestive organs)
meant by TCM. Generation of Qi and Blood with Spleen is deeply related
to Lungs and Kidney. Lungs take &quot;Qi of the sky&quot; by breath, and
Kidney transports the energy gotten from parents when giving birth to each
Zangfu of the body. These all combine together to fill up Qi and Blood.
The reason why herpes break out so frequently among elderly citizens is
considered to be because of decrease in Kidney's energy. However, for a
younger generation usually this energy is plenty and a reason of frequent
herpes break out is considered to be problems with Spleen. <BR>

      �@</FONT><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic">First of all, it is mandatory to excercise right eating habits.Adding unnecessary
load on Spleen by overeating cold dishes, raw vegetables and junk foods
should be avoided by all means. For those who are over weight may have
to go through dieting. However. dieting without considering nutritional
balance should be avoided for your health's sake. </FONT><FONT size="+2" color="#000000"><BR>
