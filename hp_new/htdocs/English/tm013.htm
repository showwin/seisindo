        <td width="650" align="left"><b><font size="+1">&nbsp;Since early times it was said that �gAcne�h is a symbol of youth. For
        10�fs it may be fine to put in that way but it is not as such for 20�fs and
        30�fs. When one is in one�fs 10�fs one might be able to say out loud that
        one has �gAcne�h. However, as time goes by the same symptoms change the name
        to �gPimple�h. Especially for females when they start to work and wear make-ups
        �gAcne�h also turn for the worse. <br>
        In addition, �gAcne (pock)�h mark will disappear soon when one is in one�fs youth. However, with increasing age darken pock mark will be left on the skin as pigmentation. Though �gAcne�h is a symptom on the skin surface it comes from deep within body as it is said �gskin is a mirror of the internal organs�h. <br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="+2" color="#0000ff">In TCM </font><font size="+1"><br>
        Though it depends on kind of �gAcne�h and physical constitution the direct cause of typical �gAcne�h among 10�fs and 20�fs is considered to be �gLung Heat�h.<br>
        Irregular life style, intemperateness, diet with high calorie foods and poor eating habits are considered to be indirect cause of �gLung Heat�h. Especially intake of excess spices with �gspicy food fad�h further worsens �gAcne�h.<br>
        �gAcne/Pimple�h caused by above-mentioned causes can be cured relatively easily. But such is not the case with �gAcne/Pimple�h found mostly in late 20�fs caused by �ghormonal imbalance�h. This type is hardly cured even by dermatology at the hospital/clinic. In TCM �gAcne/Pimple�h is not regarded only a matter of skin but imbalance of the whole body. Therefore, treatment of aggravated �gAcne/Pimple�h is one of the strong points of TCM.<br>
        However, eating habits and life style have to be improved by all means. For those who cannot improve above two, TCM treatment is not recommended.<br>
        <br>
        Not only acne but also scar of skin diseases and physical damage retain from subjecting the affected area to UV ray. Pigmentation will occur at the affected area and it will be difficult to remove the pock mark. For young people the pock mark will disappear quickly but it will be difficult to fade out as with aging.<br>
