<P>�@Herpes is a viral skin disease which breaks out when body's immune system is weak. Its symptoms includes bleb, autumn tint and burning pain. TCM considers &quot;Damp Heat&quot; as a direct cause of herpes. TCM considers the bleb as &quot;Damp&quot; and autumn tint as &quot;Heat&quot;. And pain is caused due to stagnation of Qi and Blood in the affected parts. </P>
<P>�@&quot;Damp Heat&quot; a concept particular to TCM. Usually moisture taken
in the body will be used effectively and unnecessary portion will be discharged
from the body. However, when the function of &quot;Spleen(a digestive organ
system at large)&quot; has weakened, or when &quot;Lungs (HAI)&quot; and
the &quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot; have weakened, this moisture will not be discharged
from the body. It stays inside of the body and becomes &quot;unnecessary
moisture&quot;. </P>
<P>�@This &quot;moisture unnecessary for the body&quot; is called &quot;Damp.&quot; When there is this &quot;Damp&quot;, &quot;Damp heat&quot; will be generater by heat wihtin the body. Imagine boiling down &quot;sugared water&quot;. As far as origin of this &quot;heat&quot; is concerned, overheated stomach deu to disorder of eating habits and life style is likely to be the cause in most cases. This &quot;Heat&quot; is called &quot;Stomach heat&quot;. Moreover, &quot;Heat&quot; may be generated from functional rise of a &quot;Liver &quot; by psychological stress. This &quot;Heat&quot; is called &quot;Liver heat&quot;. <BR>
</P>
<P>�@TCM treatment differs depending on skin condition. <BR>
�@When there is bleb, Damp Heat is removed. Then in case there is still
pain after skin has recovered to normal condition, Qi and Blood shall be
replenished.�@Frequent break out of herpes is likely to be due to your
physical constitution. TCM�@considers that herpes doesn't develop if there
is enough Qi and Blood in the body. <BR>
<BR>
�@Why does Qi and Blood become insufficient? <BR>
<BR>
�@The Qi and Blood is generated with the Spleen (the whole digestive organs) meant by TCM. Generation of Qi and Blood with Spleen is deeply related to Lungs and Kidney. Lungs take &quot;Qi of the sky&quot; by breath, and Kidney transports the energy gotten from parents when giving birth to each Zangfu of the body. These all combine together to fill up Qi and Blood. The reason why herpes break out so frequently among elderly citizens is considered to be because of decrease in Kidney's energy. However, for a younger generation usually this energy is plenty and a reason of frequent herpes break out is considered to be problems with Spleen. </P>
