<P>�@In these blocks, &quot;Qi&quot;, &quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot;, &quot;Body
Fluids (SHINEKI)&quot; and &quot;Essence (SEI)&quot; are flowing continuously,
and the liquid to moisten our body and organization also is flowing to
them, respectively. By keeping those balances, our body can function normally.
When these blocks are compared to the engine of a car,</P>
<P>&quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot; , &quot;Body Fluids (SHINEKI)&quot; and &quot;Essence
(SEI)&quot; are gasoline and &quot;Qi&quot; is a spark plug. And the liquid
moistening our body and organization is the cooling water and lubricating
oil of engine. And function of the &quot;Heart (SHIN)&quot; is a pump for
sending fuel to engine from a fuel tank. Can &quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot; be
called fuel manufacture machine? Function of &quot;Lungs (HAI)&quot; can
be called the &quot;fuel injection equipment&quot; which sends fuel to
the inside of a cylinder, and pump circulating cooling water. It is &quot;the
Liver(KAN) which is monitoring these functions and adjusting when needed.
</P>
<P>With what &quot;kidney&quot;'s function compared?<BR>
Function of a &quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot; is a &quot;battery.&quot; Sending
the electricity needed by all blocks continuously. Moreover, the electricity
obtained from function of other blocks is charged and stored. In order
to move engine normally, every parts must be in good condition functioning
properly. The body is the same as this.</P>
