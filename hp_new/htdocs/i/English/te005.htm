<P>&quot;Mibyou wo Naosu&quot; Forecasting the trouble that may develop in
the future and prevent it from hapenning beforehand. TCM considers that
the trouble develops because of loss of the balance of the body. </P>
<P>However, there is homeostasis in living creatures. Therefore, there is
a power trying to resume to the previoud condition even when the balance
is lost a little. This is so called &quot;Natural healing power. &quot;
When comparing healthy status with the &quot;Stick&quot; that stands squarely
from ground, when you are sick this stick is inclined by 60 degrees or
more. The symptom of the trouble does not appear even if this stick is
inclined at 70 or 80 degrees. Moreover, a little inclining can be resumed
to previous position by Natural healing power. However, various signs are
given as this inclination grows, and it approaches 60 degrees. For instance,
these appear that dewatering of skin, sneezing, coldness of limbs and flush.
However, you will not think you will be sick for sure. To maintain &quot;Natural
healing power&quot; which a person and animals have, we have to be in accordance
with nature, not go against it. The animal that lives in the forest and
the jungle will be able to do so. However, it is difficult for a man who
lives in the civilized society to do it. He lives in the space where it
is enclosed by concrete, air conditioned and he might have to work very
late at night and/or very early in the morning. With this, &quot;Natural
healing power&quot; cannot be maintained. Then, power to resume inclined
stick to a straight position disappeards. The sickness develops when inclining
little by little and became 60 degrees.Many people as well may say that
&quot;Supplement is taken for such time just in case&quot;. </P>
<P>However, is supplement really effective? <BR>
Does not relief arise from taking supplement?<BR>
TCM is very good at resuming the balance. There was &quot;Mibyou wo Naosu&quot;
idea in TCM from 2000 years ago. It adjusts the balance that collapses
easily in consideration of individual physical constitution. And, the Chinese
herbal medicine is taken for prevention in preparation for the sickness
that may well happen in the future. For instance, if it is originally a
person to whom &quot;Spleen(digestive organs)&quot; is weak, the Chinese
herbal medicine that makes &quot;Spleen&quot; strong is taken. Moreover,
if it is an aged person with &quot;Kidney deficiency&quot;, Chinese herbal
medicine that supplements Kidney is taken. However, it is not good to rely
on only the Chinese herbal medicine. Priority should be given to the life
in accordance with nature, right eating habits and harmony with nature.
