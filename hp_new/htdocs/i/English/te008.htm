<BLOCKQUOTE>Dizziness</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;Dizziness&quot; such as Meniere's disease etc. with unclear cause is one of diseases that Western medicine is not good at. <BR>
However, &quot;dizziness&quot; with unclear cause is an easy disease to treat with TCM on the other hand. <BR>
Inside of normal person, Qi, Blood and Body fluids are circulating regularly without stagnation. <BR>
However, when this flow is too much or stagnated with some reasons it will cause some changes to your body. <BR>
TCM considers that when this change is caused at Upper Jiao symptoms such as dizziness will appear. </P>
<P>&quot;Headache due to six external evils&quot;<BR>
&quot;Headache due to six external evils&quot; is generated by six &quot;External evils(Surrounding climate change and life environment, etc.)&quot; of &quot;Wind, Cold, Summer Heat, Dryness, Damp, Fire&quot; because it influences the body, and &quot;Flow of Qi and Blood&quot; is obstructed. <BR>
Especially, the headache is generated by &quot;Wind-evil&quot; and &quot;Cold, Summer Heat, Fire, Wet&quot;'s combining. These are classified into the category of &quot;Acute headache&quot; in the West medicine. </P>
<P>��TCM classifies cause of dizziness into three. <BR>
�P�CIn case flow to head becomes too much. <BR>
�Q�CIn case flow down from head is stagnated. <BR>
�R�CIn case there is not enough energy to circulate Qi, Blood and Body fluids through out the body. <BR>
<BR>
In case of 1, in many cases stress is related and is likely to accompany irritation. <BR>
In case of 2, it is likely for those who intake excessive fluid. <BR>
In case of 3, it is likely among the elderly and women after delivery. </P>
<P>These are mere references and not a cause to all dizziness. <BR>
Usually it is rare to come up with a patient with textbook dizziness. <BR>
In most dizziness these are overlapped to cause the symptom. <BR>
Dizziness found particularly many recently is the one caused by �gexcess intake<BR>
of fluid�h. <BR>
Western medicine recommends taking more fluid however it is the opposite with TCM. <BR>
Upon taking excess fluid more than the body requires, this all turns into �gDamp&quot; <BR>
(fluid unnecessary to body) and cause some problems.  Dizziness is only an example. <BR>
Particularly dizziness which worsens on the rainy days is likely to be due to excess intake of fluid. <BR>
Only creature to intake more than necessary fluid is �ghuman-being�h on the earth. <BR>
Be sure to look out for those who excessively intake fluid as usual.�@</P>

<P>Not only the Chinese herbal medicine but also training is necessary for treating the bed-wetting. The bed-wetting doesn't recover over a night. Timely treatment without hurry or panic as to obtain effective result is the key. <BR>
Moreover, the bed-wetting of the adult has increased recently. Many people are worried alone because bed-wetting of grown-ups seems embarrasing. A serious disease might be hidden in the bed-wetting of the adult, therefore, please do consult with me.</P>
