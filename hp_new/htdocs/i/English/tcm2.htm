<P>�@Let's explain Traditional Chinese Medicine briefly.�@<BR>
The character in a parenthesis is the reading in Japanese.<BR>
</P>
<P>�@In TCM, the body is divided into five blocks, &quot;Liver (KAN)&quot;,
the &quot;Heart (SHIN)&quot;, &quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot;, &quot;Lungs (HAI)&quot;,
and &quot;Kidney (ZIN).&quot; These five blocks are called &quot;Five Organs.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
�@&quot;Liver (KAN)&quot; does not mean the &quot;liver&quot; meant by Western medicine.<BR>
The &quot;Liver (KAN)&quot; controls an autonomous nerve and stores nutritive substance. Especially &quot;Liver (KAN)&quot; keeps &quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot; . &quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot; in TCM is considered as not only &quot;blood&quot; meant by Western medicine but also nutritious material composing our body. If a &quot;Liver (KAN)&quot; runs short of &quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot;, an autonomous nerve will be disturbed and muscles, eyes, etc. will be affected. &quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot; of a &quot;Liver (KAN)&quot; running short, is called &quot;Blood deficiency of Liver (KAN KEKKYO)&quot;. When &quot;Blood deficiency of Liver (KAN KEKKYO)&quot;, is present eyes will get dry or legs get cramp easily. Moreover, in a woman, abnormalities menstrual period appear.</P>
<P>�@&quot;Heart (SHIN)&quot; does not mean the &quot;heart&quot; meant by
Western medicine.<BR>
The &quot;Heart (SHIN)&quot; is in charge of control of thought, memory,
etc.. If the &quot;Heart (SHIN)&quot; falls into poor condition, it many
cause Alzheimer's disease or insomnia. Moreover, &quot;small intestine&quot;
and &quot;tongue&quot; may be affected. In the case of the &quot;Heart
(SHIN)&quot;, heart not fall into poor condition on its own. When it is
in poor condition there should be influence from other blocks of our body.
</P>
<P>�@&quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot; means a whole digestive organs and whole its
function. Consumed foods is digested by stomach and then sent to &quot;Spleen
(HYI)&quot;to produce &quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot; and &quot;Qi from food
and drink&quot; as driving force of our body. &quot;Qi&quot; here expresses
invisible and ever-flowing energy of life. When &quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot;
falls into poor condition , it cannot generates &quot;Qi&quot; and &quot;Blood
(KETSU)&quot; from consumed foods, therefore, it will affect whole body.
Moreover, since &quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot; has function to carries athing,
moisture metabolism also becomes poor. When &quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot; is
in poor condition, &quot;the organization between the skin and muscles&quot;
and a &quot;mouth&quot; will be affected. </P>
