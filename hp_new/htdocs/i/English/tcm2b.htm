<P>�@&quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot; does not mean the &quot;kidney&quot; meant by
Western medicine. A &quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot; controls growth, generation,
and reproduction. And it stores the &quot;Essence (SEI)&quot; which is
the source of a life. There are &quot;Congenital Essence&quot; and &quot;Acquired
Essence&quot; in &quot;Essence (SEI).&quot; &quot;Congenital Essence&quot;
is given when we are born by our parents. And &quot;Acquired Essence&quot;
is generated from &quot;Qi&quot; and the &quot;&quot;Blood�@(KETSU)&quot;
which were made from our own body. Both of these &quot;Essence (SEI)&quot;
is united and called &quot;Essence of a Kidney (ZINSEI).&quot; &quot;Essence
(SEI)&quot; could also be called life energy. If &quot;Essence of a Kidney
(ZINSEI)&quot; runs short, senility will appear. When &quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot;
falls into poor condition, &quot;bone&quot;, &quot;brain&quot; , &quot;ear&quot;,
and &quot;reproduction capability&quot; will be affected. The state where
the &quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot; weakened is called &quot;Kidney deficiency
(ZINKKYO)&quot;, and it could cause of infertility etc.</P>
