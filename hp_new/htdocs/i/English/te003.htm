<P>�@Probably, except for those who have a problem in the mouth, there would
be no one going to hospital for halitosis.�@ However, once you realize
the smell, it could bother you much, doesn't it ?�@Do you try to get away
with it by chewing a gum or licking a candy ?�@Even if you try various
methods, there is no decisive method to solve the problem.�@Even if you
go to dentist to have it checked, doctor would say &quot;I do not see any
problem&quot; and whole thing will go back to zero.�@If it is diagnosed
as &quot;gingivitis&quot;, the cause will be clarified and method for treatment
also. �@</P>
<P>�@Since the halitosis when gust arose, when hungry and after excercise
is a physiological phenomena and it would not be categorized into halitosis
dealt here. </P>
<P>TCM does its work here !</P>
<P>TCM considers stomach heat as direct cause of halitosis.�@However, there
are more indirect cause.</P>
<P>Let's take out and take a look at a tongue in front of a mirror.<BR>
Is center to back parts of your tongues surface yellowish or light yellow coated ?</P>
<P>�@Overeating of sweets, highly seasoned food, greasy food, spices and excessive
drinking of alcohol will cause heat in stomach.�@Also physicall stress
is one indirect factors causing heat in stomach.�@By cooling down heat
in stomach halitosis ingeneral will be gone.�@However, it applies to only
the case where the cause of stomach heat has occurred from eating habits
only. In other cases, there should be another cause for generation of heat
in stomach. So the cause must be sought after and treat the cause.�@One
of Chinese herbal medicines to cool down heat in stomach is &quot;BOUFU-TSUSHO-SAN&quot;.
However, if you tend to have soft stool and diarrhea regularly, prescription
with &quot;HEII-SAN&quot; or &quot;RIKKUNSHI-TO&quot; is recommended.�@</P>
