�@Unlike Western medicine, &quot;Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM)&quot;
considers and treats the whole body for any type of illness. For example,
it does not treat only skin or stomach in case of dermatitis and gastritis.
The cause is considered and treated by having a look at whole body. The
question is &quot;why the symptoms of dermatitis or gastritis are there?&quot;<BR>
�@The whole body will be divided into &quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;Yang&quot;
if the concept of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) is explained briefly.
&quot;Yin&quot; points out a thing with a form such as blood, lymph, etc.
which constitutes the body. <BR>
A function, work, etc. of internal organs is called &quot;Yang&quot;, and
it points out a thing without a form. <BR>
TCM considers, I think that illness breaks out because the balance of this
&quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;Yang&quot; collapses. Under the medical treatment
of TCM, it investigates which part of the body has broken down its balance
and how.<BR>To normalize collapsed balance of the body is the treatment.<BR>
There are various means. Acupuncture and treatment with medicine are typical.
Although it is originally a more complicated concept, it shall be explained
only briefly here.<BR>
�@Especially the &quot;medicine&quot; used under the medical treatment
of TCM is called &quot;Chinese herbal medicine (in Japan, it is called
Kanpo Medicine)&quot;, and it is made from the natural plant, mineral,
etc. For Chinese herbal medicine is made of natural materials many people
may misunderstand that there is no side-effect in Chinese herbal medicine.
However, if the Chinese herbal medicine which does not suit a constitution
is taken, side- effects may appear.<BR>
�@Imagine seesaw, an adult sits on the right and a child sits on the left Balance is not maintained in this state. This is the sickness. By lightening the right side or putting more weight on the left, balance will be maintained again. However, collapse of balance will be larger, if more weight is put on the right or weight is taken away from the left. This is the onset of side- effects by taking wrong medicine.<BR>
The most important part is that constitutional predisposition could completely differ under same disease.<BR>
Therefor same Chinese herbal medicine does not necessarily work for the same disease. &quot;TCM is the medicine of balance&quot; is said from this.</P>
