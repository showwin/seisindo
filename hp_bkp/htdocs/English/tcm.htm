considers and treats the whole body for any type of illness. For example,
it does not treat only skin or stomach in case of dermatitis and gastritis.
The cause is considered and treated by having a look at whole body. The
question is &quot;why the symptoms of dermatitis or gastritis are there?&quot;<BR>
      　The whole body will be divided into &quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;Yang&quot;
if the concept of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) is explained briefly.
&quot;Yin&quot; points out a thing with a form such as blood, lymph, etc.
which constitutes the body. A function, work, etc. of internal organs is
called &quot;Yang&quot;, and it points out a thing without a form. TCM
considers, I think that illness breaks out because the balance of this
&quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;Yang&quot; collapses. Under the medical treatment
of TCM, it investigates which part of the body has broken down its balance
and how.<BR>

it is originally a more complicated concept, it shall be explained only
briefly here.<BR>
      　Especially the &quot;medicine&quot; used under the medical treatment
of TCM is called &quot;Chinese herbal medicine (in Japan, it is called
Kanpo Medicine)&quot;, and it is made from the natural plant, mineral,
etc. For  Chinese herbal medicine is made of natural materials many people
may misunderstand that there is no side-effect in Chinese herbal medicine.However,
if the Chinese herbal medicine which does not suit a constitution is taken,
side- effects may appear.<BR>
      　Imagine seesaw, an adult sits on the right and a child sits on the left
Balance is not maintained in this state. This is the sickness. By lightening
the right side or putting more weight on the left, balance will be maintained
again. However, collapse of balance will be larger, if more weight is put
on the right or weight is taken away from the left. This is the onset of
side- effects by taking wrong medicine.<BR>

      &quot;Liver &quot; keeps &quot;Blood&quot;. <BR>
      　&quot;Blood&quot; in TCM is considered as not only blood meant by Western medicine but also nutritious material composing our body. If a &quot;Liver&quot; runs short of &quot;Blood&quot;,  autonomous nerves will be disturbed and muscles, eyes, etc. will be affected. Running short of &quot;Blood&quot; in &quot;Liver&quot; is called &quot;Blood deficiency of Liver (KAN KEKKYO)&quot;. When &quot;Blood deficiency of Liver&quot;, is present eyes will get dry or legs get cramp easily. Moreover, in a woman, abnormal menstrual period appears.<BR>

      &quot;Heart&quot; is in charge of control of thought, memory, etc.. If
      &quot;Heart&quot; falls into poor condition, it may cause Alzheimer's disease
      or insomnia. Moreover, small intestine and tongue may be affected. In the
      case of the &quot;Heart&quot;, it does not fall into poor condition on
      its own. When it is in poor condition there should be influence from other
      blocks of our body. <BR>
      　</B></FONT></FONT><FONT size="+1" color="#0000ff"><FONT size="+1" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic"><FONT size="+1" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic"><B>&quot;Spleen (HYI)&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic"><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic"><B> means a whole digestive organs and their function. Consumed foods are
digested by stomach and then sent to &quot;Spleen&quot;to produce &quot;Blood&quot;
and &quot;Qi from food and drink&quot; as a driving force of our body.
&quot;Qi&quot; here expresses invisible and ever-flowing energy of life.
When &quot;Spleen&quot; falls into poor condition , it cannot generates
&quot;Qi&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; from consumed foods, therefore, it
will affect whole body. Moreover, since &quot;Spleen&quot; has a function
to carry athing, moisture metabolism also becomes poor. When &quot;Spleen&quot;
is in poor condition, &quot;the organization between the skin and muscles
and a mouth will be affected.<BR>

only breathes but also carries nutrition and moisture to the whole body
and controls skin respiration. Moreover, &quot;Qi&quot; required for the
body is conjointly generated from &quot;Qi from clear air&quot; taken in
by breathing, and &quot;Qi from food and drink&quot; made from &quot;Spleen&quot;.
When &quot;Lungs&quot; falls into poor condition, the large intestine,
the skin, etc.. will be affected. Moreover, if &quot; sprinkling function
of moisture&quot; of &quot;Lungs&quot; becomes poor, the skin will dry
or dropsy could arise. <BR>
      　</B></FONT></FONT><FONT size="+1" color="#0000ff"><FONT size="+1" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic"><FONT size="+1" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic"><B>&quot;Kidney (ZIN)&quot;</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic"><FONT size="4" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic"><B> does not mean the kidney meant by Western medicine. &quot;Kidney&quot;
      controls growth, generation, and reproduction. And it stores the &quot;Essence
      (SEI)&quot; which is the source of a life. There are &quot;Congenital Essence&quot;
      and &quot;Acquired Essence&quot; in &quot;Essence.&quot; &quot;Congenital
      Essence&quot; is given when we were born. And &quot;Acquired Essence&quot;
      is generated from &quot;Qi&quot; and the &quot;Blood&quot; which were made
      from our own body. Both of these &quot;Essence&quot; is united and called
      &quot;Essence of a Kidney (ZINSEI).&quot; &quot;Essence&quot; could also
      be called life energy. If &quot;Essence of a Kidney&quot; runs short, senility
      will appear. When &quot;Kidney&quot; falls into poor condition, bone, brain
      , ear, and reproduction capability will be affected. The state in which
      &quot;Kidney&quot; is weakened is called &quot;Kidney deficiency (ZINKKYO)&quot;,
      and it could cause of infertility etc..<BR>
      　In these blocks, &quot;Qi&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Body Fluids
(SHINEKI)&quot; and &quot;Essence&quot; are flowing <BR>
      continuously, and the liquid to moisten our body and organization also
      is flowing to them, respectively. By keeping those balances, our body can
      function normally. When these blocks are compared to the engine of a car
      :&quot;Blood&quot; , &quot;Body Fluids&quot; and &quot;Essence&quot; are
      gasoline and &quot;Qi&quot; is a spark plug. And the liquid moistening
      our body and organization is the cooling water and lubricating oil of engine.
      And function of the &quot;Heart&quot; is a pump for sending fuel to engine
      from a fuel tank. Can &quot;Spleen&quot; be called fuel manufacture machine?
      Function of &quot;Lungs&quot; can be called the &quot;fuel injection equipment&quot;
      which sends fuel to the inside of a cylinder, and pump circulating cooling
      water. It is the &quot;Liver&quot; which is monitoring these functions
      and adjust them when needed. <BR>
      With what Kidney's function compared?<BR>
      Function of a &quot;Kidney&quot; is a &quot;battery.&quot; Sending the
      electricity needed by all blocks continuously. Moreover, the electricity
      obtained from function of other blocks is charged and stored. In order
      to move engine normally, every parts must be in good condition functioning
      properly.The body is the same as this.</B></FONT></FONT></TD>
