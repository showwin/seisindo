suitable for that particular area you live in.<BR>
      　For instance, vegetable naturally gathered in the warm provinces cannot
grow naturally in the cold provinces.　As for crops normally gathered in
winter, it cannot be gathered in winter unless we give artificial cultivation.
There is a character in each food. As for food, harvested in the warm provinces
and period, most of them cool off the body. <BR>
      And on the other hand, foods harvested in the cold provinces are likely
to warm up the body. However, development of transportation in modern days
enables us to get foods from all over the world easily regardless of where
you live in.　<BR>
      　The Japanese is not an exception. Because the Japanese has taken meals
rich in fiber for a long time, intestines are longer than the Westeners.
On the other hand, Japanese has not taken milk and dairy products from
long time ago. <BR>
      There fore, Japanese does not have much digestive enzyme for dairy products.
Many suffer from diarrhea caused by milk and some suffer from allergy as
well. <BR>
      　</FONT><FONT size="4" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic">Now, Japanese food is considered to be good for your health and is popular
all over the world.</FONT><FONT size="3" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic"><BR>
      　 Certainly, considering calorie intake and to take Japanese food several
      times a week adjust it wonld be good. However, Japanese food fit Japanese
      body and climate, thus if you live in different climate Japanese food doesn't
      necessarily suit you.　 Therefore, it is not recommended to change current
      eating habits will be changed into Japanese food. 　<BR>
      　</FONT><FONT size="4" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic">Before considering Japanese food, let's think of eating habits when your
grandfather and grandmother was still small.　It must be different from
the current food. </FONT><FONT size="3" color="#000000" face="MS UI Gothic">The bread consumed on daily basis must not have been so soft as it is today.
Only this factor alone makes number of chewing when taking bread different.　If
you eat fast, you are likely to overeat.　Moreover, they must have taken
fruits and vegetables in season. <BR>

      　 If you feel full after meal, it is assumed to be 100%. 　However, this is overeating and you should adjust amount of food so that the sense of fullness will fall about 80%. 　</FONT><FONT size="4" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic"><FONT size="4" color="#0000ff" face="MS UI Gothic"><U>This is a very good when thinking about health. </U></FONT></FONT><FONT size="5" color="#0000cc" face="MS UI Gothic"><BR>
