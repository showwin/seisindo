      There is an odor particular to it in case it is severe found among atrophic
      rhinitis, nasal inflammation, empyema and chronic sinusitis. And it is
      called ÅgOzena and Nose Odor SyndromeÅh.<br>
        In TCM the cause of this odor is considered to be ÅgDamp HeatÅh, ÅgLung Ying deficiencyÅh, and ÅgLung HeatÅh and Chinese Herbal Medicines against these causes will be prescribed.<br>
        However, the cause of ÅgDamp HeatÅh, ÅgLung Ying deficiencyÅh, and ÅgLung HeatÅh varies in internal and external factors such as physical constitution, meal habit and so on. So it cannot be simply said that Ågthis Chinese Herbal Medicine is effectiveÅh. It is very important to take Chinese Herbal Medicines upon analysis of each personÅfs physical constitution suited to him/her.<br>
        In addition, there are people with only nose odor, or one with accompanied with halitosis. And there are many people The Popular Type among Young Peoplewith ÅgOlfactory Reference SyndromeÅh.<br>
        In general, it takes longer to treat Ozena than Halitosis.</font></b><br>

Among this type of people symptoms like yellow nasal discharge, sputum and halitosis are found in many cases. But if this ÅgDamp HeatÅh condition is left untreated Ying will be deficient and nasal discharge will not come out. Atrophic rhinitis is such a condition. And it becomes Ozena which takes a long time to be treated. This is the same for all disease; always keep your mind for early detection and treatment.<br>
        What is seen often recently is ÅgOlfactory Reference SyndromeÅh in which pathological condition with strong odor smelt by only him/herself although there is no nose odor is identified. Abnormality in sense of smell is caused from wrong impression of, especially, oneself has odor upon seeing gesture of the others. And also there are many those who are pointed out for nose odor from the others although there is no nasal symptom such as stuffed nose and/or nasal discharge and there is no malignancy in nasal cavity upon examination at otorhinolaryngology. In such a case, many are odor from throat from tonsillolith and so on.<br>
        At my shop, TCM for unpleasant odor from body such as Halitosis, Ozena, and Genital Smell has been researched and handled for a long time.<br>
        Recent Japanese eating habit has been changed drastically from what it used to be. So as not to generate ÅgDamp HeatÅh keeping the right eating habit is very crucial.</font></b></td>
