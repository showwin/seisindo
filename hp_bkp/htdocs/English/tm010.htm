        <td width="650" align="left"><font size="+1">&nbsp;Inflammation of the Bladder is majorly found among women. Use of
      antimicrobial agent would be sufficient if it happens only once or so in
      several years. However, there are some people who get it many times in
      a year or; in severe cases, many times in a month. For a person like this
      TCM treatment is really effective. In case of the Inflammation of the Bladder
      without detection of bacteria and frequent happening to top with it, medicines
      to be prescribed at the hospital or clinic will hardly do its work at all.
      Finally, you will be introduced to ÅgDepartment of Psychosomatic DiseaseÅh
      and be diagnosed as Irritable Bladder/Nervous Pollakiuria. Again, in such
      a case Traditional Chinese Medicines are very effective.<br>
        In TCM, it is considered that the Inflammation of the Bladder is caused by entrance of ÅgEvil of Damp HeatÅh into bladder.<br>
        ÅgDamp HeatÅh generated by stagnated ÅgDamp: liquid unnecessary to bodyÅh and body ÅgHeatÅh prevents water channel of the Bladder, thus causing the Inflammation of the Bladder. Therefore, TCM treatment will be based on to look for cause of Irritable Bladder and Nervous Pollakiuria and then to remove these evils. Treatment of Irritable Bladder, Nervous Pollakiuria and, now seems to be popular, Overactive Bladder is different from these.<br>
        In case of male, symptoms like the Inflammation of the Bladder may appear when there is abnormality in prostatic gland.<br>
