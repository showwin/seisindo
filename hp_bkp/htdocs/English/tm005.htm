      a power trying to resume to the previoud condition even when the balance
      is lost a little. This is so called &quot;Natural healing power. &quot;
      When comparing healthy status with the &quot;Stick&quot; that stands squarely
      from ground, when you are sick this stick is inclined by 60 degrees or
      more. The symptom of the trouble does not appear even if this stick is
      inclined at 70 or 80 degrees. Moreover, a little inclining can be resumed
      to previous position by Natural healing power. However, various signs are
      given as this inclination grows, and it approaches 60 degrees. For instance,
      these appear that dewatering of skin, sneezing, coldness of limbs and flush.
      However, you will not think you will be sick for sure. To maintain &quot;Natural
      healing power&quot; which a person and animals have, we have to be in accordance
      with nature, not go against it. The animal that lives in the forest and
      the jungle will be able to do so. However, it is difficult for a man who
      lives in the civilized society to do it. He lives in the space where it
      is enclosed by concrete, air conditioned and he might have to work very
      late at night and/or very early in the morning. With this, &quot;Natural
      healing power&quot; cannot be maintained. Then, power to resume inclined
      stick to a straight position disappeards. The sickness develops when inclining
      little by little and became 60 degrees. Many people as well may say that
      &quot;Supplement is taken for such time just in case&quot;. </B></font></FONT></FONT></FONT></TD>

      idea in TCM from 2000 years ago. It adjusts the balance that collapses
      easily in consideration of individual physical constitution. And, the Chinese
      herbal medicine is taken for prevention in preparation for the sickness
      that may well happen in the future. For instance, if it is originally a
      person to whom &quot;Spleen(digestive organs)&quot; is weak, the Chinese
      herbal medicine that makes &quot;Spleen&quot; strong is taken. Moreover,
      if it is an aged person with &quot;Kidney deficiency&quot;, Chinese herbal
      medicine that supplements Kidney is taken. However, it is not good to rely
      on only the Chinese herbal medicine. Priority should be given to the life
      in accordance with nature, right eating habits and harmony with nature.
