<P>　A married woman of suitable age without contraception does not get pregnant for three years or more after is considered as getting married infertility in TCM. <BR>
　Normal functions of the womb are maintained through carriage of &quot;Qi&quot;
and &quot;Blood&quot; by Meridians (way carrying nutritious substances
etc.) from Liver and Kidney. Normal function of the womb makes pregnancy
and menstrual period happen.<BR>
In TCM the view over pregnancy completely differs from that of Western
medicine. Conditions to make pregnancy possible are that there is enough
Qi and Blood in Meridians of a Liver and Meridians of a Kidney.　This &quot;Meridians
of a Liver(SHOW MYAKU)&quot; and &quot;Meridians of a Kidney(NIM MYAKU)&quot;
express the passage for carrying Qi and Blood to the womb.　Such a passage
is called &quot;Meridians&quot; with TCM.</P>
<P>　When cause of infertility is considered , it will roughly be divided
into three as following :</P>
<P>1. Although a way (Meridians) is normal, &quot;Qi&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot;
are sent neither  　from a Kidney nor a Liver .</P>
<P>2. A Kidney and a Liver, even , &quot;Qi&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot;, however,
there is some obstacles in the way (Meridians) .</P>
<P>3. There are abnormalities in a Kidney and a Liver , as well as in a way
　(Meridians).<BR>
<BR>
　In order to judge roughly , basal body temperature on a graph is used.　If basal body temperature expresses the high and the low-temperature term clearly, the cause 2 can be considered first.　However, if a high and low-temperature term is unclear, cause 1 or 3 is considered.<BR>
　Infertility due to the cause 2 can be treated comparatively fast.　Treatment of infertility due to cause 1 or 3 may take a longer time. 　However, the younger the patient is the faster cure would be.　Prompt treatment is essential.</P>
