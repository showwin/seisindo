<P>The headache is divided into &quot;Chronic headache&quot;, &quot;Acute headache&quot;,  &quot;Myotonic headache&quot;,  &quot;Cluster headache&quot;, and &quot;Migraine headache&quot;, etc in West medicine. However, in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) these are divided roughly into two such as &quot;headache due to six external evils&quot; and &quot;headache due to disorder of Zang-Fu&quot;. <BR>
The pain not only the headache but also any pain/ache is considered to be generated by staggering of flow in the TCM. <BR>
It is thought that the pain is generated in this if the flow of &quot;Qi and Blood (necessary nutritive substance and energy for body)&quot; stagnates by some causes. <BR>
For instance, it appears as &quot;Wrist pain&quot; if generated by the joint, it is a stomachache if generated by the venter and  it is a headache if generated by the head. </P>
<P>&quot;Headache due to six external evils&quot;<BR>
&quot;Headache due to six external evils&quot; is generated by six &quot;External evils(Surrounding climate change and life environment, etc.)&quot; of &quot;Wind, Cold, Summer Heat, Dryness, Damp, Fire&quot; because it influences the body, and &quot;Flow of Qi and Blood&quot; is obstructed. <BR>
Especially, the headache is generated by &quot;Wind-evil&quot; and &quot;Cold, Summer Heat, Fire, Wet&quot;'s combining. These are classified into the category of &quot;Acute headache&quot; in the West medicine. </P>
<P>&quot;Headache due to disorder of Zang-Fu&quot;<BR>
&quot;Headache due to disorder of Zang-Fu&quot; is generated by malfunction of &quot;Zang-Fu&quot;. Especially, &quot;Zang-Fu&quot; that relates to the hesdache is &quot;Liver&quot;, &quot;Spleen&quot;  and &quot;Kidney. &quot; <BR>
There are a lot of headaches that relate to &quot;Liver&quot;. &quot;Migraine
headache&quot; and &quot;Myotonic headache&quot; corresponds to these in
the classification of the West medicine.<BR>In TCM, the cause and the diathesis of the headache as mentioned above are analyzed in details and the Chinese herbal medicine is prescribed. And, the headache is treated. <BR>
For headache which happens once in a while and which stops with pain killer would not be much of a problem.  However, for headache which repeats persistently and periodically with less use of the pain killer, treatment with TCM is highly effective.</P>
